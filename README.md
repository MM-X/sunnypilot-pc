<h1>openpilot-pc</h1>
<b>在pc设备上运行sunnypilot </b>
</div>

* PC最好有GPU可以支持opencl的加速
* 实测mac的m芯片速度比较快，不需要配置第二步

<h3>
1. 环境安装
</h3>

参考 [webcam安装步骤](tools/webcam/README.md)

<h3>
2. GPU支持（可选/可跳过）
</h3>
<h4>
NVIDIA
</h4>

安装驱动
参考[官方教程](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=24.04&target_type=deb_local)

以下为官方教程精简:

```bash
# 确保安装的nvidia驱动是cuda12
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nvidia-cuda-toolkit
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cudnn/9.7.1/local_installers/cudnn-local-repo-ubuntu2404-9.7.1_1.0-1_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i cudnn-local-repo-ubuntu2404-9.7.1_1.0-1_amd64.deb
sudo cp /var/cudnn-local-repo-ubuntu2404-9.7.1/cudnn-*-keyring.gpg /usr/share/keyrings/
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install cudnn
sudo apt-get -y install cudnn-cuda-12
```

然后`tools/op.sh build`编译,之后运行就行


<h4>
AMD
</h4>

参考官方教程

<h4>
参数修改
</h4>

将[SConscript](selfdrive/modeld/SConscript)中`GPU=1`改称`CUDA=1`或者`AMD=1`; 将[modeld.py](selfdrive/modeld/modeld.py)中`os.environ['GPU'] = '1'`改称`os.environ['CUDA'] = '1'`或者`os.environ['AMD'] = '1'`

<h3>
3. 摄像机参数设置
</h3>

首先使用一些常规软件获取摄像头的内参参数(例如GMLCCalibration),主要是内参matrix矩阵
然后分别修改[camera.py](common/transformations/camera.py)和[ui.h](selfdrive/ui/ui.h)中相应摄像头的内参参数；另外根据自己的需求更改[camera.py](tools/webcam/camera.py)中的相机参数（像素和帧率，帧率最好是20的倍数，例如20,60）

<h3>
4. 数据分析
</h3>

参考 [juggler数据分析](tools/plotjuggler/README.md)

<h3>
5. 分支管理
</h3>

|    Branch    |         explain        |
|:------------:|:--------------------------------:|
| `master-new` | 同步sunnypilot的master-new分支 |
| `master-new-pc` | PC版的稳定版本分支（PC建议使用这个） |
| `master-new-pc-dev` | PC版的开发分支（定期同步最新改动），测试通过后会合入master-new-pc |
| `master-rk3588` | 针对rk3588的分支，具体参考RKPilot仓库 |

备注：master-new-pc-dev分支兼容comma3设备（适配BYD车型/优化纵向控制）

<h3>
6. 环境变量
</h3>

|    Branch    |         explain        |
|:------------:|:--------------------------------:|
| `DRIVER_CAM=x` | 启用DM摄像头（默认不启用），并指定其设备编号x |
| `NO_IMU=1` | 不使用can的上imu信息，适用于can信号里yawRate未填值的车型 |
